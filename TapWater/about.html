        TapWater is an iOS application built to help users track how much water they drink in a day.
        The app allows a user to set a goal for the number of ounces of water they wish to drink per day and track their progress as they strive to meet that goal.
        Whenever a user finishes a container of water, they can open the app and tap a button corresponding to that container,
        hence the name, "TapWater".
    </p>
    <p>
        The app was inspired by how difficult it can be to add data about water consumption to most health/fitness apps.
        TapWater seeks to alleviate this problem by allowing users to create "containers" that represent the quantities of water they drink most often.
        For example, a user may have a 25 ounce water bottle they use frequently.
        They could add the container to the app and tap it whenever they finish it off.
